Thank you for purchasing the Sci-Fi Corridors Vol. II.  A lot of effort has been put into creating this asset pack and our team is more than willing to help you setup your own scenes.

Problems, help and even more suggestions are welcome.

In order to correctly set this asset pack and enjoy it certain Unity 3D settings must be set.

- Edit>Project Settings>Quality : V Sync Count: Don't Sync
- Edit>Project Settings>Player : Rendering , Color Space Linear

Three scenes are available in the pack. Scene1 which shows all the prefabs that are offered in the pack, Scene2-Realtime and Scene3-Baked which are level demo scenes that one can use in a FPS game, realtime and baked respectivly.  Go to Window>Lighting and check Auto for baking. 


Both Realtime and Baked scenes in order to work require you to check Auto Generate from the Lighting settings.

The current pack is included in the much bigger environment pack we offer, called Sci-Fi Modular Pack. You can look for it and all that it offers here : https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/64442
